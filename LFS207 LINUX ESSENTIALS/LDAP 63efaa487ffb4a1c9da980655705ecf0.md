# **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Understand the purpose of LDAP authentication
- Know the important files in **/etc** that are involved in LDAP
- Know which utilities are available to work with these files
- Work through an exercise with with an LDAP server appliance

# **LDAP**

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a derivative of the x.500 specification for providing directory services (think phone book) via the IP protocol. LDAP provides database-style functionality specifically engineered to be fast, computationally lightweight, and robust. The LDAP application protocol details transport, directory layout (organization), and methods of access to the data for operations such as read, write, delete, etc.

LDAP can provide both authentication and authorization data. However, it is primarily used for authorization alone, with Kerberos (trusted third party authentication) being a popular choice for authentication. Interestingly, Microsoft’s Active Directory service (at least for auth/auth) is little more than LDAP and Kerberos coupled together.

LDAP is used in many Single Sign On and Identity Management solutions.

# **LDAP Authentication**

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an industry standard protocol for using and administering distributed directory services over the network, and is meant to be both open and vendor-neutral.

When using LDAP for centralized authentication, each system (or client) connects to a centralized LDAP server for user authentication. LDAP is TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) aware. TLS/SSL will provide a secure encrypted connection.

The client configuration only needs to specify a minimum amount of information to connect to an LDAP server. Elements such as LDAP server IP address, search base DN (domain name), and optionally TLS are required for authentication.

Additional user space programs are provided by the **openldap-clients** package.

**LDAP Client Authentication Process**

The graphic above shows the information path used by LDAP/SSSD. Connecting to an LDAP server starts with PAM, the pluggable authentication module. PAM is the default authentication mechanism for Linux; LDAP and SSSD are extension modules added to the default authentication configuration.

- PAM is configured to use the **pam.sss.so** module
- **`sss.so`** and **`sssd**` use a combined sssd and LDAP configuration file.

**`/etc/sssd/conf.d/00-sssd.conf`**

```bash
/etc/sssd/conf.d/00-sssd.conf
[sssd]
config_file_version = 2
domains = example.com
services = nss, pam,autofs 

[domain/example.com]
enumerate = true
id_provider = ldap
autofs_provider = ldap
auth_provider = ldap
chpass_provider = ldap
ldap_uri = ldap://192.168.122.154/
ldap_search_base = dc=example,dc=com
ldap_id_use_start_tls = true
cache_credentials = True
ldap_tls_reqcert =allow
```

# **LDAP and sssd packages**

When you configure a client system for LDAP authentication, the following files are changed:

- **`/etc/sssd/conf.d/00-sssd.conf`**
- **`/etc/pam.d/common-session.conf`**

The **`/etc/sssd/conf.d/00-sssd.conf**` file has a 2 digit prefix to allow for sequencing if more than one configuration file is being used.

The **/etc/pam.d** configuration files may be different depending on your distribution:

- CentOS 8: `**/etc/pam.d/system-auth**`
- Ubuntu 22.04: **`/etc/pam.d/common-session.cong`**

You can edit these files manually.

In previous distribution releases, there were specific utilities used for configuration. The adoption of **sssd** (System Security Services Daemon) and friends has greatly reduced the complexity of the client configuration and eliminated the need for specialized configuration tools. Text file configuration information may be configured with your favorite text editor.
