# **Chapter Overview**

Linux uses udev, an intelligent apparatus for discovering hardware and peripheral devices both during system boot, and later when they are connected to the system. Device Nodes are created automatically and then used by applications and operating system subsystems to communicate with and transfer data to and from devices. System administrators can control how udev operates and craft special udev rules to assure desired behavior results.

# **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Explain the role of device nodes and how they use major and minor numbers
- Understand the need for the udev method and list its key components
- Describe how the udev device manager functions
- Identify udev rule files and learn how to create custom rules

# **udev**

udev stands for **U**ser **Dev**ice management. It dynamically discovers built-in hardware as well as peripheral devices:

- during system boot
- when hotplugged at any time

udev handles loading and unloading device drivers with proper configurations, as need,. udev actions include:

- Device naming
- Device file and symlink creating
- Setting file attributes
- Taking needed actions

When devices are added or removed from the system, udev receives a message from the kernel. It then parses the rules files in the **/etc/udev/rules.d** directory to see if any rules are there for the device added or removed.

These rules are totally customizable and can specify device file names, device file creation, specify symlinks to be created, specify file attributes to be set for the device file (including user and group ownership), and even specify actions to be taken (programs to be executed).

Devices nodes are created automatically and then used by applications and operating system subsystems.

System administrators can control how udev operates and craft special *udev rules*.

# **Device Nodes**

Character and block devices have device nodes; network devices do not. These device nodes can be used by programs to communicate with devices through nodes using normal I/O methods.

A device driver may use multiple device nodes. Device nodes are located in the **/dev** directory.

Command:

**`$ ls -l /dev`**

Output:

```bash

Device nodes can be created with the following command:

**`$ sudo mknod [-m mode] /dev/name <type> </major> <minor>**e.g. **sudo mknod -m 666 /dev/mycdrv c 254 1**`

**Device Nodes**

# **udev Components**

udev runs as a daemon (either udevd or systemd-udevd) and monitors a netlink socket. When new devices are initialized or removed, the uevent kernel facility sends a message through the socket, which udev receives and takes appropriate action to create or remove device nodes of the right names and properties according to the rules.

The three components of udev are:

- The **libudev** library which allows access to information about the devices.
- The **udevd** or **systemd-udevd** daemon that manages the **/dev** directory.
- The **udevadm** utility for control and diagnostics.

The cleanest way to use udev is to have a pure system; the **/dev** directory is empty upon the initial kernel boot, and then is populated with device nodes as they are needed. When used this way, one must boot using an initramfs image, which may contain a set of preliminary device nodes, as well as the the udev infrastructure.

**udev Rules**

# **udev Rule Files**

udev rules files are located under **/etc/udev/rules.d/<rulename>.rules** and **/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/<rulename>.rules** with names like:

- **30-usb.rules**

**90-mycustom.rules70-mouse.rules60-persistent-storage.rules**

There are two separate parts defined on a single line:

- The first part consists of one or more match pairs denoted by **==**. These try to match a device’s attributes and/or characteristics to some value**.**
- The second part consists of one or more assignment key-value pairs that assign a value to a name, such as a file name, assignment, even file permissions, etc.

If no matching rule is found, it uses the default device node name and other attributes.

Command:

**`$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/99-fitbit.rules`**

Output:

**`SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="2687", ATTR{idProduct}=="fb01", SYMLINK+="fitbit", MODE="0666"`**

Command:

**`$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/60-vboxdrv.rules`**

Output:

```bash
KERNEL=="vboxdrv", NAME="vboxdrv", OWNER="root", GROUP="vboxusers", MODE="0660"
KERNEL=="vboxdrvu", NAME="vboxdrvu", OWNER="root", GROUP="root", MODE="0666"
KERNEL=="vboxnetctl", NAME="vboxnetctl", OWNER="root", GROUP="vboxusers", MODE="0660"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh $major $minor $attr{bDeviceClass}"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device",
RUN+="/usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh $major $minor $attr{bDeviceClass}"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", ACTION=="remove", RUN+="/usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh --remove $major $minor"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="remove", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device",
RUN+="/usr/lib/virtualbox/VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh --remove $major $minor"
```

# **Creating udev Rules**

Rules files can be in three places, and if they have same name the priority order is:

1. **/etc/udev/rules.d**
2. **/run/udev/rules.d**
3. **/usr/lib/udev/rules.d**

The format for a udev rule is simple:

**<match><op>value [, ...] <assignment><op>value [, ... ]**

There are two separate parts defined on a single line. The first part consists of one or more match pairs (denoted by double equal signs). These will match a device’s attributes and/or characteristics to some value. The second part consists of one or more assignment key-value pairs that assign a value to a name, such as a filename, group assignment, or even file permissions.

Samples:

```bash
KERNEL=="sdb", NAME="my-spare-disk"
KERNEL=="sdb", DRIVER=="usb-disk", SYMLINK+="sparedisk"
KERNEL=="sdb", RUN+="/usr/bin/my-program"
KERNEL=="sdb", MODE="0660", GROUP="mygroup"
```

If no matching rule is found, it uses the default device node name.

See **man udev** for explanation of the key values such as **SYMLINK** and **RUN**.

# **Examples of Rules Files**

Here is an example of a rules file for a Fitbit device (command and output):

**`$ cat /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/99-fitbit.rules`**

```bash
**SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="2687", ATTR{idProduct}=="fb01", SYMLINK+="fitbit", MODE="0666"**
```

Here is an example for creating crash dumps and fast kernel loading with **kdump**/**kexec** (command and output):

**`$ cat /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/98-kexec.rules`**

```bash
**SUBSYSTEM=="cpu", ACTION=="add", PROGRAM="/bin/systemctl try-restart kdump.service"
SUBSYSTEM=="cpu", ACTION=="remove", PROGRAM="/bin/systemctl try-restart kdump.service"
SUBSYSTEM=="memory", ACTION=="online", PROGRAM="/bin/systemctl try-restart kdump.service"
SUBSYSTEM=="memory", ACTION=="offline", PROGRAM="/bin/systemctl try-restart kdump.service"**
```

Here is an example for the kvm virtual machine hypervisor (command and output):

**`$ cat /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/80-kvm.rules`**

```bash
**KERNEL=="kvm", GROUP="kvm", MODE="0666"**
```
